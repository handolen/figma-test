                <h1 class="baslik">HEALTH WARNING</h1>
                <p class="yazi">Always play in a well lit environment. Take regular breaks, 15 minutes every hour. Discontinue playing if you experience dizziness, nausea, fatigue or have a headache. Some individuals are sensitive to flashing or flickering lights or geometric shapes and patterns, may have an undetected epileptic condition and may experience epileptic seizures when watching television or playing videogames. Consult your doctor before playing videogames if you have an epileptic condition and immediately should you experience any of the following symptoms whilst playing: altered vision, muscle twitching, other involuntary movement, loss of awareness, confusion and/or convulsions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="kutu kutu3">
                <h1 class="baslik">3D HEALTH</h1>
                <p class="yazi">Some people may experience discomfort (such as eye strain, eye fatigue or nausea) while watching 3D video images or playing stereoscopic 3D games on 3D televisions. If you experience such discomfort you should immediately discontinue use of your television until the discomfort subsides.
    
                    Generally we recommend that you avoid prolonged use of your PlayStation®3 system and take 15 minute breaks during each hour of play. However, when playing stereoscopic 3D games or watching 3D video, the length and frequency of necessary breaks may vary from person to person – please take breaks that are long enough to allow any feelings of discomfort to subside. If symptoms persist, consult your doctor.
                    
                    The vision of young children (especially those under six years old) is still under development. We recommend that you consult with your child’s doctor or optometrist before allowing young children to watch 3D video images or play stereoscopic 3D games. Adults should supervise young children to ensure they follow the recommendations listed above.</p>
